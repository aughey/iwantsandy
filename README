This is the start of a clone of the iwantsandy service for use in a local environment.  I relied on iwantsandy so much that I decided to implement the functionality that I use on my own.

There are some enhancements too, such as a more terse e-mail reminder system for iPhone and mobile use, as well as a really slick iPhone/iPod Touch web interface.

The primary use is for e-mail reminders.  The remembering part was really of no use for me, but if someone wishes to implement this with a good argument for having it, be my guest.

Dependencies:
tmail, rails, net/imap (with ssl for gmail), haml, Chronic

Plan:

I'm working on the system in several stages based on need.

E-Mail interface (you are here)
  The email interface is my primary interface to the system.  Except
  doing the initial account setup, I did all my interfacing with Sandy
  through e-mail.  Half of the time it is e-mails forwarded to Sandy
  with a heading "r tomorrow" and the other half of the time it is one
  line e-mails saying something like "r friday take back library books".

Basic Web Interface
  All of the information is stored in the database, and presenting it
  with show actions is quite easy.

Comprehensive Web Interface
  What goes here?  If the primary interface is e-mail, I don't really
  want to make a whole calendar system.  That has already been done 
  better before.
